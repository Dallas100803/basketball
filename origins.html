  <h1>Origins of the Game</h1>
  <main>
      <h2>What is "Basketball"?</h2>
      <p>Basketball is a popular team sport played between two teams, each consisting of five players. The objective of the game is to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team's basket, which is mounted 10 feet high on a rectangular backboard. The game is usually played indoors, but it can also be played outdoors. The popular sport is played worldwide, and its origins can be traced back to the late 19th century.</p>

      <h2>James Naismith and the Invention of Basketball</h2>

      <p>In December 1891, Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith was tasked with creating a new game to keep his students active during the winter months. The result was basketball, a game initially played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets used as goals.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <p>Basketball is a fast-paced and dynamic sport that requires a combination of skills such as shooting, dribbling, passing, and teamwork. It is played at various levels, from casual pick-up games to professional leagues around the world. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most prominent and widely watched professional basketball leagues globally.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the sport's key features:</p>
      <ol>
  <li>
      <strong>Court:</strong> The game is typically played on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end. The court is divided into two main sections, each with a hoop at either end. The court is further divided into various marked areas, such as the three-point line and the free-throw line.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Teams:</strong> Each team consists of five players on the court at any given time. Teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Scoring:</strong> Points are scored by successfully shooting the ball through the opponent's basket. A field goal made from outside the three-point arc is worth three points, and a shot made from inside the arc is worth two points. Free throws, awarded after certain fouls, are worth one point each.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Dribbling and Passing:</strong> Players use a combination of dribbling (bouncing the ball while walking or running) and passing to move the ball around the court.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Game Duration:</strong> A standard basketball game is divided into four quarters, each lasting a specific amount of time. Overtime periods may be played if the score is tied at the end of regulation.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Violations and Fouls:</strong> There are various rules and regulations, including violations such as traveling, double dribble, and shot clock violations. Fouls are penalized with free throws or possession changes, depending on the nature of the foul and the situation in the game.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Strategy:</strong> Basketball involves strategic play, with teams employing offensive and defensive tactics to outscore their opponents. Coaches often devise plays and strategies to exploit the strengths of their team and exploit the weaknesses of the opposing team.
  </li>
  </ol>

      <h2>Spread and Evolution of the Game</h2>
      <p>From its humble beginnings, basketball quickly gained much popularity and spread to other parts of the United States and beyond. The first official game was played at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>
